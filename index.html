<p>Welcome to Just Enough Acres, a family owned hobby farm located just outside the town of Duvall, Washington.  We're just getting started, but in just over a year we've gone from one Chihuahua to 23 animals, including 8 goats, 7 ducks, 4 chickens, 2 cats, and 2 dogs.  We've also added a small greenhouse, a raspberry patch, and 320 square feet of raised garden beds.  This year we should have 2-4 baby goats, which means 2 of our goats will be producing milk, so we should be able to make some cheese!  We're also expecting eggs from 5 of our ducks and all 4 of our chickens.  There are 2 male ducks in with the females, so hopefully we'll get some ducklings as well.</p>

<a href="http://www.yellowbirchhobbyfarm.com/">Yellow Birch Hobby Farm</a> has a web page I like.  It's well laid out, easy to read, and scales to fit any width.  The menu structure is well defined, so the user can quikcly navigate to what's of interest.  The social media buttons occupy too much visual real estate in my opinion.
